Summon Aery OP and nerfed -
patch 7.22 to 7.23 changes

Was summon aery too op?

Opinions as summon aery has been nerfed, it is more of a support tool now then ever but is still stronger than wind speakers blessing.


"
Past the balance side of things, we've adjusted post-30 EXP curves and the First Win of the Day mission reward based on your feedback. Hearing your thoughts is incredibly important to us, so please keep them coming! We're also knocking out a few longstanding feature requests: The Skins Tab, the ability to spectate Challengers, and about a year's worth of updates to the Game Info site all land this patch!" RIot

doesn't change anything anyway
